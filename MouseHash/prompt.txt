I am working on a neuroscience project called MouseHash, which combines Neuropixel probe data from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) API with machine learning techniques to analyze neural activity.
Project Overview:

    Hashing Probe Locations
        Fetch probe locations (MLAPDV coordinates) from the IBL API.
        Compute t-SNE embeddings to represent spatial probe distributions.
        Train a neural hashing model to assign probes into discrete hash buckets.

    Embedding Neural Activity with CEBRA
        Aggregate spike train data based on hashed probe locations.
        Train a CEBRA model to extract a latent trajectory of neural activity.

    Quantizing CEBRA Trajectories with Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)
        Train a SOM on the CEBRA latent space.
        Identify clustered neural states and compare them with experimental phases.

What I Need Help With Next:

    Writing Python code to implement specific parts of the pipeline.
    Optimizing t-SNE, neural hashing, or SOM parameters.
    Visualizing CEBRA trajectories and SOM clusters.
    Structuring data processing and storage efficiently.
    
The goal is to compress high-dimensional neural activity into discrete meaningful states and analyze circuit-level dynamics in an interpretable way.
